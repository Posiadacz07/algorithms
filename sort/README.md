# Sort algorithms
In this directory you can find sort algorithms written in C++11.

To compile single program use:

`$ g++ sort/name_of_sort.cpp -std=c++11`

or

`$ clang++ sort/name_of_sort.cpp -std=c++11`


### Sort algorithms to implement:
| sort name      | status  |
| -------------- | ------- |
| bubble sort    | `DONE`  |
| bucket sort    | `DONE`  |
| counting sort  | `DONE`  |
| cycle sort     | `DONE`  |
| heap sort      | `DONE`  |
| insertion sort | `DONE`  |
| merge sort     | `DONE`  |
| odd-even sort  | `DONE`  |
| quick sort     | `DONE`  |
| radix sort     | `DONE`  |
| selection sort | `TO DO` |
