# Sort algorithms
In this directory you can find sort algorithms written in C++11.

To compile single program use:

`$ g++ sort/name_of_sort.cpp -std=c++11`

or

`$ clang++ sort/name_of_sort.cpp -std=c++11`


### Sort algorithms to implement:
|sort name | status|
|--- | ---|
| bubble sort | `DONE`|
| bucket sort | `DONE`|
| counting sort | `DONE`|
| cycle sort | `DONE` |
| heap sort | `TO DO` |
| insertion sort | `DONE`|
| merge sort | `DONE`|
| odd-even sort | `TO DO` |
| quick sort | `DONE`|
| radix sort | `DONE`|
| selection sort | `TO DO`|
